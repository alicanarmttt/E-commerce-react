# E-Commerce Site

This is a basic e-commerce website built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. The application allows users to browse products, add them to the shopping cart, and view the total price of items in the cart. It demonstrates the use of **React components**, **Redux state management**, and local storage to maintain the user's basket even after refreshing the page.

### Features:
- Display list of products using `ProductList` component.
- Add products to the shopping cart with real-time updates.
- Store basket information in **local storage** for persistence.
- Manage UI states such as drawer for the shopping cart using **Redux**.
- Calculate and display the total amount of products in the cart dynamically.
